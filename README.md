#  Introduction & Overview

Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy ([SPIM, Science, 305(5686):1007-9](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/1007)) allows in toto imaging of large specimens by acquiring image stacks from multiple angles. However, to realize the full potential of these acquisitions the data needs to be reconstructed. This project implements several algorithms for the registration and fusion of multi-angle SPIM acquisitions.
